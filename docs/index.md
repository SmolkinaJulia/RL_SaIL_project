Official page for the SaIL algorithm presented in the Conference on Robotic Learning(CoRL), 2017 paper [Learning Heuristic Search via Imitation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.03034.pdf). The associated Github repository contains code instructions required for getting set up for learning heuristic functions in search based motion planning. 

We will be adding the videos and results soon!
